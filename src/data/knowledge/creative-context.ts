## Creative Context / James McKay

### The Builder
James McKay builds storyATL through Creative Context — a practice at the intersection of design, technology, and public storytelling. Based in Atlanta.

### Creative Context
Creative Context is a design and technology practice focused on building tools that make communities visible. The work spans:
- Public storytelling platforms
- Community data visualization
- Place-based digital experiences
- Projection and spatial computing

### Philosophy
The work is guided by a belief that the best technology amplifies human voice rather than replacing it. Every project starts with listening — to communities, to places, to the stories that already exist but haven't found their platform yet.
