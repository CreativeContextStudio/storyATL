## storyATL (DTN Project)

storyATL is a living archive where Atlanta tells its own stories. Every story is an Atlanta voice. Every voice has a place. The core cycle: Record. Tag. Tell Stories.

### Recording a Story
Stories can be recorded at the physical booth or through the web app on a user's own device. The same seven-step flow applies in both contexts:
1. Start — Walk up to the booth or open the web app and tap to begin
2. Consent — Read and accept the terms (your story, your rules)
3. Record — Speak your story (up to 3 minutes)
4. Title & Tags — Name it and tag it with themes
5. Location — Drop a pin and choose precision level
6. Visibility — Choose who can see it (public, community, or private)
7. Submit — Done, your story is on the map

### The Map
Every story, every voice, every place. Pins cluster by neighborhood. Filter by theme, date, or walk. Toggle MARTA lines to see transit connections. Click any pin to hear a preview. The map covers 25+ neighborhoods.

### The Shield (Privacy & Protection)
Storytellers control their own data:
- Visibility: public, community, or private
- Location precision: exact, approximate, neighborhood, or hidden
- Attribution: real name, pseudonym, or anonymous
- Content guardrails filter harmful content before posting
- Stories can be edited or removed at any time

### The Night (Public Projections)
Stories leave the app and find public screens and projections. Booths at events have displays with generated stories. Projection mapping turns building facades into living narratives — text scrolling across walls, voices echoing off concrete. Gesture recognition lets passersby interact with projected stories using their bodies and hands.

### The Plan
Six phases over 18 weeks:
1. Foundation: Core platform — recording, consent, storage, map integration
2. Community Layer: Neighborhood profiles, walk routes, community moderation tools
3. Discovery: Search, filters, thematic collections, MARTA transit layer
4. Projection: Projection mapping system, rover integration, gesture recognition
5. Public Launch: Public beta, community onboarding, first projection events
6. Sustain: Documentation, handoff, sustainability plan, archive protocols
