## The Five Voices

storyATL features five representative voices from across Atlanta's neighborhoods:

1. **Marcus** (Vine City) — Theme: Community care
   "We don't just live here — we hold each other up. Every porch is a meeting place, every block has its own rhythm."

2. **Linh** (Buford Highway) — Theme: Migration
   "My parents came here with two suitcases and a recipe. Now the whole corridor tastes like home — everyone's home."

3. **Deja** (Old Fourth Ward) — Theme: Change
   "I watched them tear down the stadium. I watched them build condos. Nobody asked us what we wanted to keep."

4. **Robert** (Old Fourth Ward) — Theme: Home
   "Home isn't the building — it's the corner, the tree, the sound of the train at 2 AM. You can't demolish that."

5. **Aisha** (Sweet Auburn) — Theme: Music
   "Auburn Avenue raised every sound this city ever made. Gospel on Sunday. Jazz on Friday. Trap on Tuesday."

These voices represent five neighborhoods, five themes, and five ways Atlanta speaks. They are composites — representative of real stories and real people, not specific individuals.
