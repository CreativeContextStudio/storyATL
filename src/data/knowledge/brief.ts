## PAFL Application Brief

storyATL is a 2026 application to the Public Art Futures Lab (PAFL). PAFL supports projects at the intersection of public art, technology, and community engagement.

### What is PAFL?
The Public Art Futures Lab is a program that funds and supports innovative public art projects that use technology to engage communities in new ways.

### The storyATL Proposal
storyATL proposes a city-scale storytelling platform where residents record, map, and share personal stories tied to specific places in Atlanta. The project combines:
- A physical recording booth and a web app for community story collection — stories can be recorded in person or remotely
- An interactive digital map showing stories by neighborhood
- Projection mapping that brings stories into public space at night
- Privacy-first design giving storytellers full control over their data

### Key Stats
- 9 guided exchanges walk visitors through the concept
- 5 representative voices from 5 neighborhoods
- 25+ neighborhoods mapped
- 18-week implementation plan across 6 phases
- 7-step booth recording process
