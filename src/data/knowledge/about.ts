## About storyATL

storyATL is a living archive where Atlanta tells its own stories. It's a public storytelling platform designed to capture, preserve, and share the voices of Atlanta's diverse neighborhoods.

### Mission
To make communities visible, not just heard. storyATL gives every neighborhood a voice on the map — from Vine City to Buford Highway, Summerhill to Sweet Auburn.

### How It Works
Residents visit a recording booth or use the web app on their own device to record a story (up to 3 minutes), tag it with themes and a location, and submit it to the map. Stories appear as pins on an interactive map and can be filtered by neighborhood, theme, date, or walking routes. At night, stories are projected onto building facades using projection mapping technology.

### Core Values
- Community ownership: storytellers control their own data
- Privacy by design: multiple layers of consent and visibility controls
- Place-based: every story is tied to a specific location in Atlanta
- Accessible: the booth interface is designed for all ages and abilities
- Living: the archive grows as more people contribute
