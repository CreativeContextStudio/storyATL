## Atlanta

Atlanta is a city of layers — every generation builds on top of the last, but the stories underneath never fully disappear.

### Neighborhoods
Atlanta's identity lives in its neighborhoods. Each one carries its own history, rhythm, and voice:
- **Vine City**: Historic Black community near the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, known for tight-knit bonds and mutual aid
- **Buford Highway**: Atlanta's international corridor — Vietnamese, Korean, Mexican, Salvadoran, Ethiopian communities side by side
- **Summerhill**: One of Atlanta's oldest neighborhoods, transformed by stadium demolitions and new development
- **Old Fourth Ward**: Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthplace, now a mix of historic preservation and rapid change
- **Sweet Auburn**: The historic heart of Black business and culture in Atlanta — "the richest Negro street in the world"

### The City's Character
Atlanta is a place where civil rights history meets hip-hop culture, where Southern tradition meets tech innovation. It's a city that keeps reinventing itself, sometimes at the cost of the communities that made it what it is. storyATL exists to make sure those stories don't get paved over.
